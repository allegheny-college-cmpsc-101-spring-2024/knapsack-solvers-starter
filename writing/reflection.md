## Program Understanding

### Using at least one paragraph, explain how the greedy-by-value algorithm works

TODO: Using your own words, provide a response to this question using at least one paragraph.

### Using at least one paragraph, explain how the greedy-by-weight algorithm works

TODO: Using your own words, provide a response to this question using at least one paragraph.

### Using at least one paragraph, explain how the greedy-by-density algorithm works

TODO: Using your own words, provide a response to this question using at least one paragraph.
TODO: Remember that greedy-by-density is the same as greedy-by-ratio.

### Using at least one paragraph, explain how the exhaustive algorithm works

TODO: Using your own words, provide a response to this question using at least one paragraph.

### What are some ways in which the use of a knapsack solver connects to other areas of computer science?

TODO: Provide an answer to this question using your own words.
TODO: You may conduct online research to answer this question.
TODO: If your response to this question leverages online sources, please cite them correctly.

### How many items are inside of the powerset of the list of items in Table 14-1? Why?

TODO: Provide a response to this question with a specific number and an explanation.

TODO: Your response to this question should clearly and fully explain
the both the specific number for the items in Table 14-1 and a
general-purpose equation that illustrates the relationship between `n`,
the number of values in a set and the number of values in the set's
powerset.
